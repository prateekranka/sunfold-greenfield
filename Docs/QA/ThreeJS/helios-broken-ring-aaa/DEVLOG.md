# Helios Rift — Broken Ring devlog

This log records rendered corrections for the active Three.js map. Each cycle starts from
the live game, changes one bounded visual system, and ends with a Git commit and a dev-only
deployment after its focused gates pass.

## Cycle 00 — takeover baseline · 2026-08-09

Status: **Proof Pending**

### Preserved behavior

- Four broad ring sectors and four broken gaps.
- Eight data-driven bridges, including four core routes.
- Four expansion islets and four starting areas.
- Solar objective, solar flare, resource nodes, minimap, selection, movement, and repair.
- Eight Citizens and four Lumen Guards in the local player's opening group.

### Observed rendered result

- The complete ring fits the normal 1600×900 in-app Browser viewport.
- The topology is immediately recognizable as a broken ring.
- The browser console has no warning or error entries.
- The HUD reports 12 units and 30 FPS.
- Commit `ac20998` is visible on `origin/main`.
- The same bundle is deployed at `https://dev.helios.contenthelper.in/` as Worker version
  `2ce69824-e2f7-4ce3-91f4-80bdf6003042`.
- Hosted and local bundle SHA-256 values both equal
  `f4d64d0dc655d19b4c45b31e7b7a484e2e46fc581ed7bb3edb4e9c42debc7d8f`.

### Highest-leverage mismatch

The scene is too dark, flat, and top-down compared with the approved reference. The current
fog suppresses the upper sectors. The shallow platform read hides the authored
understructure. The solar core is a small pale marker instead of the dominant orange star.

### Focused checks

- `node Tools/citizens/build-helios-play-site.mjs` — passed.
- Scoped `node --check` for the Helios, map, camera, Guard proof, and deploy sources — passed.
- Data contract: four visual fragments, four spawn pads, eight resource zones, eight bridges,
  and finite visual bridge endpoints — passed.
- `git diff --check` — passed.
- In-app Browser render — played at the default viewport with 12 units and no console errors.

### Next cycle

Correct composition readability. Adjust only Helios camera presentation, fog/exposure,
platform depth cues, and solar-core authority. Rebuild and compare before any geometry
detail expansion.
